PI Implementation steps:
Prerequisites:
1.	Instance assessment: 
a.	Data Quality and Completeness:  Review data consistency, data accuracy, and data completeness. The input and output should be valid and correct to train the model to make accurate predictions.
b.	Cleanliness: Sanitized data reduces noise, making the model more accurate.
c.	Data Model: Analyze the underlying data structure for efficiency and effectiveness.
d.	Data volume: Determine if sufficient data exists for model training.
e.	Data velocity: Evaluate the frequency of data updates and its impact on model retrain.
f.	Performance: Evaluate the performance of the machine learning environment.
2.	Predictive intelligence Plugin:
a.	Clone development instance and activate predictive intelligence plugin(com.glide.platform_ml). When you activate the plugin, any dependent plugins are activated automatically.
b.	Validate plugin settings and configurations.
c.	Review and validate roles.
3.	Performance Analytics:
a.	Verify If Performance Analytics is enabled and configured.
b.	Assess the data sources available for predictive intelligence.
c.	Evaluate the ability to visualize predictive model outputs.
Requirements:
a.	Gather in detailed requirements on the following topics:
b.	Determine the data points necessary for building a model. This might include historical data.
c.	Build condition sets to create solution model definitions.
d.	Data quality checks: Implement data validation rules and scripts.

 

Configuration: 
1.	Implement a custom stopwords list based off Customer Requirements. 
2.	Implement a custom word corpus based off the Customer Requirements.
3.	Define and create clustering solutions:
•	Setup clustering solutions based on the condition sets.
•	Quick start tests to Validate that Predictive Intelligence still works after you make any configuration change.
•	Submit and train a cluster 
•	Validate/retrain solution based on the results.
•	Analyze a cluster with a data source
4.	Monitor and refine: Continuously monitor model performance and retrain as needed to maintain accuracy.
5.	Regular Retraining: Scheduling regular retraining helps in maintaining the model's performance over time. This is especially important in dynamic environments where data evolves rapidly.

Choose and Configure Machine Learning Models:
1.	Model selection: Based on use cases and data, select appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, time series).
2.	Model configuration: Fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance. 
3.	Model training and evaluation: Train the model on historical data and evaluate its accuracy using appropriate metrics.
4.	Parameter Tuning: As the model matures, you may need to fine-tune parameters to optimize performance and results.
Reporting:
•	Visualize predictions: Use Performance Analytics to create dashboards and reports to visualize model outputs.
•	Identify trends: Analyze prediction patterns to uncover insights and opportunities for improvement.
•	Predictive Intelligence Studio: Build and manage machine learning models.

Best Practices
a.	Start small: Begin with a focused use case to gain experience and build confidence.
b.	Iterative approach: Continuously improve the model based on feedback and performance evaluation.
c.	Leverage ServiceNow expertise: Utilize available resources and documentation to accelerate implementation.
d.	No Code or low code model based on ServiceNow recommendation.
