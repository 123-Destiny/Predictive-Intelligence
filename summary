Predictive Intelligence Implementation Summary

Prerequisites:

Instance Assessment:

Data Quality and Completeness: Ensure data is consistent, accurate, and complete to train the model effectively.
Cleanliness: Sanitize data to reduce noise and improve model accuracy.
Data Model: Analyze the data structure for efficiency.
Data Volume: Confirm there’s enough data for model training.
Data Velocity: Evaluate how frequently data is updated and its impact on model retraining.
Performance: Assess the machine learning environment’s performance.
Predictive Intelligence Plugin:

Clone the development instance and activate the predictive intelligence plugin.
Validate plugin settings, configurations, and roles.
Performance Analytics:

Verify that Performance Analytics is enabled and configured.
Assess available data sources for predictive intelligence.
Evaluate visualization capabilities for predictive model outputs.
Requirements:

Gather detailed requirements on data points necessary for building the model, including historical data.
Create condition sets to define solution models.
Implement data quality checks through validation rules and scripts.
Configuration:

Create a custom stopwords list and word corpus based on customer requirements.
Define and set up clustering solutions:
Validate that Predictive Intelligence works after configuration changes.
Train, validate, and retrain clusters based on results.
Monitor and Refine: Continuously monitor model performance and retrain as needed.
Regular Retraining: Schedule regular retraining to maintain model performance, especially in dynamic environments.
Choosing and Configuring Machine Learning Models:

Model Selection: Choose algorithms (e.g., regression, classification) based on use cases and data.
Model Configuration: Fine-tune parameters for optimal performance.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train models on historical data and evaluate accuracy using metrics.
Parameter Tuning: Continuously fine-tune parameters to optimize results.
Reporting:

Visualize Predictions: Use Performance Analytics for dashboards and reports.
Identify Trends: Analyze prediction patterns for insights.
Predictive Intelligence Studio: Manage machine learning models.
